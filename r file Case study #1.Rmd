#Palmber-Penguins

##DATSET- Case Study

The Palmer penguins dataset by **Allison Horst**, *Alison Hill*, and *Kristen Gorman* is a dataset for data exploration & visualization, as an alternative to the Iris dataset. The dataset contains data for 344 penguins.

It was very exciting to explore the world of 'R'-language. I really enjoyed this.
